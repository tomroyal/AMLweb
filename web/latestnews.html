<p>3 April 2016</p>

<p>British Journal of Photography is inviting photographers to be a part of Portrait of Britain​, a nationwide exhibition showing the face of modern Britain.

<p>Photographers may submit portraits of family, friends, themselves or simply people they find interesting, and we welcome pictures from every corner of Britain, from casual snapshots and selfies to documentary projects and street photography. We want to see portraits that reflect the unique heritage and diversity of our country.

<p>British Journal of Photography​ will select 100 winning portraits for a nationwide public exhibition to be showcased on JCDecaux digital screens. Visible on high streets, roadsides and in transport hubs across the length and breadth of the country for the month of September 2016, the exhibition will be seen by an audience of millions.

<p>Portraits must have been taken after 1st January 2010, and depict subjects living in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland) when the photograph was taken. Portraits can be shot using any camera model, film or digital, and images may be portrait, landscape or square in format. Both working photographers and non­-professionals are welcome to apply.

<p>Deadline for entries: Midnight (BST) Monday 20 June 2016

<p>For more information visit: portraitofbritain.uk

<p>From Simon Bainbridge, Editorial Director at British Journal of Photography:

<p>“When public art works really well it has an engagement with its surroundings and local population and that's what we want to do with Portrait of Britain. If you genuinely want your work to be seen by the public and not just a bunch of gallerists and publishers in a metropolitan city, this is a unique opportunity to get your work out to an extraordinary amount of people.”
