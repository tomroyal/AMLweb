	<p><b>British Journal of Photography is inviting photographers to be a part of Portrait of Britain​, a nationwide exhibition showing the face of modern Britain.</b>
	
	<p>Photographers may submit portraits of family, friends, themselves or simply people they find interesting, and we welcome pictures from every corner of Britain, from casual snapshots and selfies to documentary projects and street photography.

	<p>British Journal of Photography​ will select 100 winning portraits for a nationwide public exhibition to be showcased on JCDecaux digital screens. Visible on high streets, roadsides and in transport hubs across the length and breadth of the country for the month of September 2016, the exhibition will be seen by an audience of millions.
	
	<p>Portraits must have been taken after 1st January 2010, and depict subjects living in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland) when the photograph was taken. Portraits can be shot using any camera model, film or digital, and images may be portrait, landscape or square in format. Both working photographers and non­-professionals are welcome to apply.

	<p>For more information visit: portraitofbritain.uk
	
	<p>From Simon Bainbridge, Editorial Director at British Journal of Photography:
	
	<p>“When public art works really well it has an engagement with its surroundings and local population and that's what we want to do with Portrait of Britain. If you genuinely want your work to be seen by the public and not just a bunch of gallerists and publishers in a metropolitan city, this is a unique opportunity to get your work out to an extraordinary amount of people.”

	<p><b>The world’s longest running photography publication relaunches on 02 March with a new look and expanded editorial sections run across 50 percent extra pages.</b>

	<p>At a time when British Journal of Photography is read by more people in more places than ever before, reaching 650,000+ followers on social media, we are investing further in our 162-year-old print magazine, giving it a thorough refresh to ensure it remains the world’s most authoritative and cutting-edge publication devoted to the art and commerce of contemporary photography.
	
	<p>The new-look magazine has been redesigned front-to-back to give more space to arresting images and in-depth analysis of the contemporary photography scene. In addition to expanding the page run, we have introduced a heavyweight premium cover stock, alongside three different high-quality papers inside, and bold new typography that reflects the visual sophistication of the global creative community we serve.
	
	<p>Since our last major redesign six years ago, which saw BJP switch from its 150-year-old weekly format back to the monthly edition it began with in 1854, the magazine has launched award-winning iPad and iPhone editions, collected the title of Photography Magazine of the Year at the Lucies (the Oscars of the photography world), and three years ago became an independent publisher following a management buyout.
	
	<p>“In that time there’s been a massive revival of interest in print, led by an army of small independent publishers with uncompromising standards and the shared belief that the coming together of provocative photography, sharp design and intelligent wordcraft should be an artform in its own right,” says editorial director Simon Bainbridge. 
		
	<p>“We share that passion. A magazine is much more than the sum of its glossy-wrapped parts; it should inspire, surprise, provoke and inform. We began our redesign with the objective of decluttering the pages and giving the photography space to be star billing. We also wanted to add a little change of pace to the different sections, which we’ve done with the layouts and use of four different paper stocks.
	
	<p>“Since we began in 1854, British Journal of Photography has set the standard for photographic journalism, continuously redefining what we do to reflect changing trends and practices, and strive to better serve our loyal readership. We will continue to search out work from the world’s leading photographers, championing the emerging generation and presenting them alongside established talent. But more than that, we aim to bring context and analysis to our award-winning formula, and deliver a magazine that informs, inspires and surprises.”
	
	<p>The first new-look issue, our April edition (out 2 March), is themed around science and technology. Alongside interviews with Michael Benson about his pioneering space imagery, we feature Daniel Stier’s work on the surreal world of scientific experiment, Reiner Riedler’s investigation into lifesaving medical machines, and Laura Morton’s photo essay on tech entrepreneurs in San Francisco Bay. 
	
	<p>Our May issue is focused on commissioned photography, and June features the best from our annual worldwide talent call.
