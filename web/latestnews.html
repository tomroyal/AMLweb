<a name="101014"><h2>Sad news regarding fltr</a></h2>

<p>10th October 2014</p>

<p>Apptitude Media is sad to announce that the next issue of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fltr-smartphone-photography/id743908845?mt=8">fltr</a>, the weekly iPhone magazine, will be the last.

<p>When we launched fltr we wanted to create a publication that would do justice to the groundswell of talented people taking great photos using their smartphones, by highlighting their very best work and interviewing the photographers who were leading this new movement. We hope we’ve achieved this aim, and we’re very proud of the many great articles, and even more great photos, that we’ve published in fltr’s 44 issues to date.

<p>However, despite many loyal readers and commercial support, fltr has not grown enough to support producing the kind of quality journalism we want to publish on an ongoing basis. And, although it would be simple to cut costs and keep publishing something of a lower quality, we’d rather admit that fltr was a bold experiment that didn’t work out.

<p>Issue 44 of fltr will be the last published, and the app will be taken off-sale at the end of October. Those who have the app will be able to download back-issues until the end of 2014. Current subscribers will be offered a subscription to the British Journal of Photography’s dedicated iPhone edition, which is published weekly.

<p>We’d like to thank everyone who has contributed to fltr over the past year, from our talented writers and editors to our featured photographers and everyone who downloaded the magazine, and we look forward to seeing where smartphone photography will go in the years to come - even if we’re not the ones reporting on it.

<p>London, 10th March 2014</p>

<p>Investment Europe, a leading magazine for fund selectors and investment professionals across Europe, has launched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/investmenteurope/id815029080?ls=1&mt=8" target="new">a new version of its iPad edition</a>.</p>

<p>Investment Europe has been available as an app since 2012. Now, as a result of further investment from Open Door Media Publishing Ltd, it has been redesigned and relaunched by the <a href="http://www.apptitudestudio.com/" target="new">Apptitude Studio</a> team, who have spent the last six months reworking the design and functionality to improve the reader experience.</p>

<p>There is a natural affinity between the two businesses, as Apptitude was formed by Incisive Media's former Finance Director, Marc Hartog, following a management buyout of British Journal of Photography magazine in February 2013, and Open Door Media was formed by one of Incisive Media's founders, Nick Rapley, who led a separate buyout of Investment Europe later that year. Incisive Media has invested in both businesses and the relationship between the three enterprises remains strong.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.magplus.com" target="new">Mag+ platform</a>, the new-look Investment Europe app is dynamic and interactive. Readers can pull, swipe and pinch content, and product providers can make their marketing interactive or more valuable by embedding video of their fund manager, or pdfs of their fund fact sheets, for example.</p>

<p>CEO of Apptitude Studio Marc Hartog states: "We are delighted to work with Investment Europe to help bring the magazine to life on the Mag+ platform.  The forward-thinking Open Door Media team have taken their previously flat replica and applied a bespoke design with just the right amount of interactive elements to create a really compelling digital version of the magazine.  We are at the beginning of the biggest change to how people consume content in a generation, and it is innovation like this that will encourage adoption by both readers and advertisers."</p>

<p>Nick Rapley, CEO of Open Door Media Publishing, adds: "In an ever-changing media landscape, it is vital for B2B brands to evolve with innovative ways to engage readers and showcase advertisers. The Apptitude Studio team have been instrumental in bringing Investment Europe magazine to life in an interactive touchscreen environment, embedding social media and live news into the heart of our dynamic new app for fund selectors and investment professionals across Europe."</p>

<p>From the creators of British Journal of Photography, iPhone magazine FLTR applies established multi award-winning expertise to smartphone photography, inspiring the next generation of digital image creators.</p>
<p>London 16th December 2013: FLTR, the world’s first-ever weekly magazine dedicated to smartphone photography and published exclusively on the iPhone, has launched today on Apple’s App Store.</p>
<p>Created by the team behind the multi award-winning British Journal of Photography magazine, FLTR is designed to be an authoritative voice within the booming worldwide community of smartphone image creators, including exclusive interviews with both amateur and professional photographers highlighting the latest techniques, apps, devices, trends and accessories in smartphone photography.</p>
<p>Issue one of FLTR features a thought-provoking article by Fred Ritchin, professor of photography and imaging at New York University and former picture editor of The New York Times Magazine, writing about the incredible impact smartphones would have had during a traumatic event such as the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC.

There is a look at the photo-sharing and discovery app EyeEm and a Christmas gift guide suggesting the perfect ingredients for professional looking smartphone photography.</p>
<p>Available to download from the Apple App Store from today, and then every week, FLTR is built on the Mag+ platform creating a clean, intuitive, user interface bespoke for the iPhone. Edited by Olivier Laurent, associate editor of British Journal of Photography, FLTR will encourage readers to engage with the brand and each other to decide what content to showcase and give them the opportunity to be published within the magazine.</p>
<p>FLTR is designed to engage with an audience of passionate smartphone photographers, eager to develop their skills and learn about products that will help improve their images.

<p>Olivier Laurent, Editor of FLTR, said: “The iPhone has transformed and democratised photography – turning all of us into potential photographers. It is estimated that more than 880 billion images will be taken over the next 12 months, and smartphones will play a leading role in the production and distribution of these images. FLTR is designed specifically to offer a new breed of photographers a weekly dose of authoritative content and advice to help them take their photography to the next level, while also chronicling the massive changes we're also experiencing, thanks to the ubiquitous nature of the smartphone.”</p>
<p>Marc Hartog, CEO of Apptitude Media, said: “It is an exciting development as a publisher to create a bespoke publication built around smartphone photography that is designed for, and distributed on, the same device.

<p>CEO of Apptitude Media, Marc Hartog, who also won Publishing Innovator of the Year at the PPA Awards earlier this year, states: “I am really proud of the team. We are starting to realise our ambition for BJP: publishing a niche, UK-based magazine as an independent start-up and winning the kind of industry recognition lavished on some of the bigger, more established players. And realising that we are the most popular photography magazine in the world on Facebook, in the same week as winning App of the Year, is the icing on the cake."</p>
<p>The award-winning niche magazine has transformed its fortunes with the introduction of a custom-made app for the iPad, built on the Mag+ platform. Since launching the app in September 2011, British Journal of Photography has more than doubled its paying subscriber base, and the app has to date been downloaded more than 270,000 times.</p>

                <p>London, 6 September 2013</p>

            	<div class="phonly"><img src="./img/sp320.jpg"></div>
                <p>Today Apptitude is proud to unveil a new online service: <a href="https://www.subs-plus.com" target="new">Subsplus</a>.
                <p>Subsplus is designed to work alongside the <a href="http://www.magplus.com" target="new">Mag+ platform</a>. Where Mag+ makes it simple to create elegant publications and distribute them on tablets and phone devices, Subsplus allows app owners to manage access to those publications.</p>
                <p>For magazine publishers, Subsplus manages subscriptions. Publishers can add subscribers online, either individually or in bulk, and those subscribers can then log in and download their issues instantly. It's ideal if you want to give free access to print subscribers, or offer complimentary copies to advertisers, freelancers or staff.</p>
                <p>For enterprise app developers, Subsplus allows managers to control access to information on a per-user basis. A Mag+ enterprise app with Subsplus can be configured to show nothing until the user has logged in - at which point all relevant publications appear for download in their Library. Again, users can be added individually or in bulk.</p>
                <p>The entire system is set-and-forget: once users or subscribers are added, Susbplus silently manages password resets and new content added to Mag+ Publish.</p>
                <p>Subsplus is offered as a fully managed online service - no coding required - and can be added to a Mag+ app within 24 hours without an app update. For more information on features and pricing, please <a href="http://apptitudemedia.co.uk/contactus.html" target="new">get in touch</a>. Or, in the USA, contact your Mag+ representative.</p>

<p>Marc Hartog, CEO and Founder of new digital media company Apptitude Media, last night won Publishing Innovator of the Year (Annual Turnover Under £10M) at the 2013 PPA Awards in London.</p>

<p>The PPA stated “Marc Hartog has been a huge driving force behind revolutionising the British Journal of Photography from a beautiful print magazine to a genuine multi-channel global brand. He quickly realised the title’s digital potential and turned it into a global opportunity, and has gone after each new opportunity with a rare single-minded focus. All of this, combined with his obvious passion for the brand, makes him a worthy winner of the Publishing Innovator of the Year award for 2013.” </p>

<p>Marc added "The PPA awards are the Oscars of our industry, so to be shortlisted was a great accolade in itself - to win against such stiff competition was both surprising and humbling. I am very honoured to receive the award and consider it recognition for everybody who is part of the Apptitude Media family and the whole British Journal of Photography team."</p>

<p>Under Marc’s leadership, the award-winning niche magazine transformed its fortunes with the introduction of a custom-made app for the iPad, built on the Mag+ platform. Since launching the app in September 2011, British Journal of Photography has more than doubled its paying subscriber base, and the app has now been downloaded over 200,000 times. </p>

<p>Marc successfully led a management buyout of the British Journal of Photography, which has been in print since 1854, from Incisive Media at the beginning of 2013, to form Apptitude Media, taking the team behind British Journal of Photography with him. </p>

<p>The team also recently launched a UK iPad edition of Popular Science, one of the most widely read publications in the world, and Fade To Black - a new quarterly magazine for the iPad focusing on independent film-making.</p>

<p>Other partnerships include cutting-edge fashion and lifestyle magazine 125, brought to the iPad for the first time. The creative arm of Apptitude Media, <a href="http://www.apptitudestudio.com" target="new">www.apptitudestudio.com</a> offers the same award-winning expertise to clients of all genres, the most recent being the Sundance London iPhone app. </p>

<p>British Journal of Photography has redesigned its iPhone and iPad apps, bringing its award-winning print content to readers all across the world. Now called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/british-journal-photography+/id635263304?ls=1&mt=8" target="new">British Journal of Photography+</a>, the new universal iOS app offers a dedicated experience depending on the device used.</p>
<p>On the iPad, BJP is now offering a new monthly tablet edition that is closer in content to the print magazine, with the same features but enhanced with additional images, text and videos. Previously, BJP only offered a quarterly iPad edition, which will continue to be supported until the end of 2013.</p>
<p>On the iPhone, the magazine is now offering a weekly edition designed to bring you the best of the monthly edition in smaller, more frequent issues. "We've been working hard to find a way to re-imagine what we do for the smartphone, and we think we've got something different to offer - a more elegant solution to the iPhone magazine than anything else out there right now," says Marc Hartog, founder and CEO of Apptitude Media, BJP's publisher. "Eventually, this will be the place where you'll be able to read our articles first, before they are published in our print and tablet editions."</p>
<p>The app and the first iPad and iPhone issues are free, with subscription offers starting from £1.99 a month. iPad subscribers get free access to the iPhone issues, and BJP will soon offer bundled subscription offers to print subscribers.</p>

<p>The team behind the award-winning British Journal of Photography are excited to announce the launch of an international quarterly magazine for the iPad, dedicated to a new generation of image-makers who embrace the convergence of photography, video and multimedia. Fade To Black hits the App Store today and the first issue is available <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fade-black/id605352564?ls=1&mt=8">to download free</a>.</p>

<p>Featuring interviews with cutting-edge image-makers working in fields such as documentary, art video, music promos and drama, documentary, fashion film, music promos, art videos and shorts, alongside previews of the upcoming movies, festivals and exhibitions, Fade To Black champions the creative zeitgeist, showcasing the most exciting emerging independent talent.</p>

<p>“I believe we are at the beginning of a new era of free-thinking creativity,” says editor Simon Bainbridge. “Technology is a huge driver in all the changes we are witnessing. The arrival of HDSLR cameras and affordable editing software has brought cinematic quality filmmaking to the masses, and along with the emergence of crowd funding and view-on-demand networks, it’s never been as easy to make a movie. But it’s the ideas and storytelling skills of the photographers, directors, producers and cinematographers that makes for great art. That’s why our focus is on the creative impetus behind our featured projects, providing an insight into the ideas process behind the scenes”.</p>

<p>Like any good movie, Fade To Black has a beginning, middle and end; the first focused on agenda items for the spring ahead, while the middle is devoted to major profiles and features, and the end covering new trends and Q&As with the people who commission image-makers. For Issue #1, American artist Victoria Crayhon was commissioned to shoot a moving still for the cover, and inside there are interviews with fashion photographer turned filmmaker Elaine Constantine and Michael Najjar, the self-styled first artist into space, alongside Kelly Richardson, who talks about her hi-tech installation artworks, and Shaul Schwartz, whose first feature length documentary explores narco culture and the glorification of drugs lords in the Mexican badlands.</p>

<p>Built using the Mag+ platform, the magazine is optimised for Retina display, and includes navigational features designed to make best use of the iPad environment, learned from the highly acclaimed British Journal of Photography app. </p>

<p>Fade To Black can be downloaded free <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fade-black/id605352564?ls=1&mt=8">from the App Store</a>.</p>

<p>The new magazine will officially launch at the Sundance London film and music festival, which takes place 25-28 April at The O2, for which Fade To Black is the official digital media partner.

<p>Launched in 2011, the Positive View Foundation has taken a unique approach to philanthropy, through a fruitful engagement with the world of photography, adding an exciting new dimension to the visual arts.
<p>With an international scope, the Positive View Foundation’s major exhibitions have historical and contemporary elements, and showcase exceptional work from both masters of photography and rising talents.

We are delighted to be given the opportunity to become the Foundation’s philanthropic partner, sharing our expertise as publishers and, in particular, our knowledge of apps. We look forward to developing our dialogue, with a view to exchanging ideas and opening up our networks, working towards our mutual benefit.”</p>

                <h2>Apptitude Media | A shift in perspective</h2>

<h3>New digital media “start-up” with a 160 year old brand at its heart</h3>
 <p>LONDON, 05 February</p>
<h3>Apptitude Media | A shift in perspective</h3>
</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p>New digital media &ldquo;start-up&rdquo; with a 160 year old brand at its heart<br>
  <br>
  Launching today as a new digital media company, Apptitude Media has an award-winning portfolio, and promises to help-reinvent the magazine, combining old-world publishing expertise with a proven talent for publishing to tablets and smartphones.<br>
  <br>
  Founder and CEO, Marc Hartog says: &ldquo;We are at the very beginning of a publishing revolution. Magazines have been around for nearly 300 years, and they will be around for the next three centuries in one way or another, but what form they will take is being shaped right now.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  Marc successfully led a management buyout of the British Journal of Photography, which has been in print since 1854, from Incisive Media and has subsequently completed a first-round of investment to form Apptitude Media. Incisive Media are taking a minority stake in the new enterprise.<br>
  <br>
  Apptitude Media comprises the team behind the British Journal of Photography (BJP), the award-winning niche magazine that transformed its fortunes with the introduction of a custom-made app for the iPad. Since launching the app in September 2011, BJP has more than doubled its paying subscriber base, and the app has now been downloaded over 200,000 times. The team also recently launched a UK iPad edition of Popular Science, one of the most widely read publications in the world. Other partnerships include cutting-edge fashion and lifestyle magazine 125, brought to the iPad for the first time.<br>
  <br>
  Based in Soho, London, the fifteen strong team encompasses all areas of expertise in app publishing. According to Gregg Hano, CEO of Mag+ and former SVP of Bonnier corporation:  &ldquo;In my opinion the team are doing some of the best work in the digital publishing space, among the top 1% of digital publishers in the world.&rdquo; <br>
                                 <br>
  Apptitude Media offers a bespoke service consulting with publishers, blending creativity, visualisation and innovative technology to help them re-imagine their print titles as truly interactive digital magazines. From design through to app production, the Apptitude team will guide clients through the complex process of gaining compliance and approval for their apps, and advise them on how to market and sell their products via online retailers such as Apple&rsquo;s Newsstand.<br>
  <br>
  Apptitude Media is actively pursuing partnerships with any business looking to capitalise on the fast-growing readership opportunities offered by tablets and smartphones, and their global user base.<br>
  <br>
  Marc concludes: "I am looking forward to working with a world class team, fresh ideas and new launches, working hard, having fun, and just being part of the most exciting time in publishing in a generation.&rdquo;<br>
